# 3D-geometry-reconstruction
Filamentous structures are ubiquitous in biology, helping organisms to maintain their structural rigidity, swim, and obtain food. Examples of such structures include microtubules, actin filaments, bacterial flagella, sperm flagella, and cilia. Their geometrical properties and motion are studied in numerous biology fields by imaging them using different microscopic techniques. However, the resolution of the studies is often limited by the diffraction of light, meaning that objects smaller than half the wavelength of the light laterally and the wavelength of the light axially will appear blurry in light microscopy. Furthermore, without three-dimensional (3D) knowledge of the studied structures and the processes that they go through, our understanding of subjects is incomplete. There are numerous methods to achieve higher resolutions and perform 3D microscopy, including confocal microscopy, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, and photoactivated localization microscopy; however, they sacrifice temporal resolution to achieve higher spatial resolution, which makes them unsuitable for imaging live cells and fast processes, and they require sophisticated and expensive equipment. Furthermore, a fast, efficient image analysis method is required to study the captured microscopic images regardless of the imaging technique. The image analysis method needs to achieve subpixel accuracy in localizing the filament to result in a smooth curve representing the filament and perform well in low signal-to-noise ratio, which is common in microscopic images. Thus, developing a fast image analysis framework, which can localize a 3D filamentous structure captured by widely used, high-speed imaging techniques such as fluorescence microscopy would bridge these gaps and increase the accuracy of geometrical measurements and motion studies.<br>
The proposed research achieves this goal in three tasks: 1) Developing a framework to reconstruct 3D geometry from microscopic images of filamentous structures. 2) Implementing the framework on an example problem of a set of videos of bacterial flagella stretching in a shear flow. 3) Performing force and deformation analyses on geometries reconstructed in (2).

HERE IS A PREVIEW OF THE RESULTS THAT OUR FRAMEWORK PRODUCES: (Paper to be published soon!) <br>
simulated images are generated from the 3D geometries obtained from the genetic algorithm optimization on the microscopic iamges. <br>

THE METHOD IS EASILY IMPLEMENTED ON STACKS OF IMAGES TOO!<br>
